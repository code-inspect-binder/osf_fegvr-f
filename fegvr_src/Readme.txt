This is a readme for the dataset for the research article:

"Body-based units of measure in cultural evolution" (Kaaronen, Manninen and Eronen 2022).

### Column explanations

* Culture: Name of the culture or ethnic group. Where applicable, HRAF code is in brackets.
* Region: Region based on HRAF typology.
* Subregion: Subregion based on HRAF typology.
* SCCS: TRUE if the culture is included in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, otherwise FALSE.
* Glottolog: Approximate Glottolog language code(s) (glottocode) for culture (glottolog.org).
* Rule description: Paragraphs or snippets of text from original references, where the use of body-based
measurement is explained.
* Reference: Original sources of rule descriptions, designated by numbers ([1], [2], etc.).
* Time period: The coverage date(s) of evidence or ethnographies in references (based mostly on HRAF "coverage date").
* Subsistence types: Subsistence types based on HRAF data and HRAF typology.
* Database: The database where references were searched from.
* Lat: Latitude (coordinates), rough estimate of location of culture on world map.
* Long: Longitude (coordinates), rough estimate of location of culture on world map.
* Notes: Other comments.
* Most recent evidence: The most recent date from column "Time period" (designates most recent evidence of body-based measurement).

## Themes

Each culture is coded with themes (under column: "Themes"), which describe the context in which body-based units of measure are used.

Themes include:

* "Tech-garment": 	Body-based units are used in the design of clothes or garments.
* "Tech-weapon": 	Body-based units are used in the design of weapons.
* "Tech-transport": 	Body-based units are used in the design of vehicles.
* "Tech-building": 	Body-based units are used in the design of buildings.
* "Tech-household": 	Body-based units are used in the design of household equipment.
* "Tech-fishing": 	Body-based units are used in the design of fishing equipment.
* "Tech-agri": 		Body-based units are used in the design of agricultural equipment.
* "Tech-instrument": 	Body-based units are used in the design of musical instruments.

* "Trade":	Body-based units are used for trade, in markets and barter, or as units (or measurement) of currency.
* "Agriculture":Body-based units are used in agriculture (or horticulture), e.g., in measuring cultivated land or agricultural products.
* "Ritual":	Body-based units are used in ritual, ceremonial, religious, burial, or divination purposes.
* "Animal":	Body-based units are used to measure the size (or value) of animals/livestock.
* "Cooking":	Body-based units are used in cooking and the measurement of food items.
* "Medical":	Body-based units are used for medical purposes.
* "Games":	Body-based units are used in the context of games or play.

* "Linear":	Body-based units measure linear distance (one-dimensional; between two points).
* "Area":	Body-based units measure area (two-dimensional space).
* "Volume":	Body-based units measure volume (three-dimensional space).

* "Named":	Instances where local names of body-based units of measure are mentioned.
* "Tailored":	Instances where body-based units of measure are mentioned explicitly to be used in designing custom-sized (i.e., ergonomic) technologies.
* "Temperature":Instances where the body is used to measure temperature (e.g., when something is “too hot to touch” or of “body temperature").

* "Activity": 	Units of measure based on physical activity.

## Body dimension

Each culture is coded with a typology of body dimensions (under column "Body dimension"):

* "Fathom": 		Arm span. Distance between fingertips of outstretched arms. Variations include, e.g., the fathom with closed fists.
* "Hand-span": 		Hand span. Distance between the tip of the extended thumb to the tip of one of any four other fingers on an outstretched hand. Also known simply as a “span”.
* "Cubit": 		Forearm (ell). The distance from the tip of the elbow to the tip of an extended finger (typically the middle finger). Also sometimes measured to the closed fist or wrist, or from elbow crease to fingertips, etc. Other similar forearm-based units are included.
* "Arm-length": 	Arm length. Any units based on the length of an arm, typically from tip of outstretched fingers to one of the following: armpit, shoulder, or middle of chest (half-fathom).
* "Finger-width": 	Width of one or several fingers (or fingernails), excluding the thumb (see “thumb width”).
* "Hand-width":		Width of the palm (also known simply as the “palm”). Also includes the width of four fingers or the fist, or the circumference of the palm.
* "Pace": 		A pace, step or stride.
* "Finger-length": 	Length of any of the four fingers, thumb excluded (see “thumb length”). Includes the length of finger joints and combinations thereof.
* "Foot": 		Inner or outer length of the foot. Also includes foot width.
* "Height":		A person’s height from toes to the tip of the head, or to the tip of vertically extended arms. Also includes measures of height to other specified points of the upper body (e.g., navel, eyes, forehead).
* "Handful":		Cupped hand (handful) or two cupped hands (double handful), a measure of volume. 
* "Thumb-width": 	The width of the thumb (including nail-width).
* "Fistmele":		Width of the fist with an extended thumb (similar to “thumbs up” gesture).
* "Thumb-length": 	The length of the thumb or thumb joint(s).
* "Hand-length": 	The length of a hand, typically from the wrist joint/crease to the tip of the middle finger.
* "Arm-thickness":	As thick as the arm (or wrist).
* "Armful"		As much as a person can carry in both arms (a measure of volume), or the circumference the arms can surround.
* "Pinch"		A small measure for volume measured by pinching the thumb against the tip of a finger (e.g., a “pinch of salt”).
* "Leg-length"		The distance from the sole of the foot to the knee or hip.
* "Ring":		Measure of circumference made by pinching the tip of a finger to the thumb (similar to the “OK” or “ring” gesture).
* "Leg-thick": 		As thick as (any part of) the leg.

N.B. Under the "Rule description" column, some special characters may not be correctly transcribed. This is because many sources are digitized, 
and optical character recognition (OCR) often fails to recognize special characters. Some spelling mistakes (including those from HRAF data) 
have been corrected, but please refer to the original sources if you wish to ensure correct spelling of non-English terminology.
